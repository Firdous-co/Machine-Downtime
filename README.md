# Machine-Downtime
This project analyzes machine downtime to help identify the root causes of interruptions, optimize maintenance schedules, and improve overall productivity. By leveraging data analysis and visualization, we gain insights into downtime patterns and critical factors impacting machine performance, ultimately minimizing unplanned downtime and increasing production efficiency.

Project Overview
The Machine Downtime Analysis project aims to analyze machine performance and identify key factors contributing to downtime events. The analysis provides actionable insights that can guide maintenance teams in planning preventive and predictive maintenance activities, thus reducing downtime costs and improving operational efficiency.

Objectives
Identify patterns in machine downtime across different time frames (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).
Determine the most common causes of downtime and affected machines.
Analyze downtime duration and frequency to prioritize maintenance activities.
Forecast potential downtime risks and implement preventive measures.
Features
Downtime Trend Analysis: Track downtime patterns over different periods to identify trends.
Cause Analysis: Discover common causes of machine failures, such as component wear, operator error, or power issues.
Frequency and Duration Analysis: Measure downtime frequency and duration to understand the impact on production.
Predictive Maintenance Insights: Use historical data to anticipate future downtime events and optimize maintenance schedules.
Interactive Data Visualizations: Visual representations to support quick interpretation and better decision-making.
